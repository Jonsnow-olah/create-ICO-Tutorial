ICO(Initial coin offering) Dapp is a web3 project that deals with how whitelists works for ICO projects in the web3 space.

This is similar to how whitelists for NFT's work, and only addresses that are whitelisted can receive tokens for the ICO.

The website has a connect wallet functionality that a user can use to connect to MetaMask or any web3 wallet extension.

If your wallet address is whitelisted, you will be eligible to claim your tokens for the ICO, if it's not whitelisted, you can't claim your tokens.

The full functionality of the website hasn't yet been implemented. I hope to work on that as time goes on.

To run the project;

Open your terminal on your code editor(Preferably VS CODE)

Cd into the my-app folder

type npm run dev

And open the link on your browser.
